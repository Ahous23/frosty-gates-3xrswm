As you stumble out of your small hut, the horrific sight greets you: the village is in ruins. Smoke rises from burned buildings, and deep claw marks scar what remains of the wooden structures.\n\nYou hear whispers among the survivors. 'Bears,' they say. 'Giant bears from the northern mountains.' Your family's hunting lodge has been destroyed, and your father's prized battle axe is missing.\n\nA fire ignites within you. These were no ordinary bears. This was deliberate. This means war.\n\nBefore you embark on your quest for vengeance, you must assess your strengths and weaknesses.",

'Your father was our greatest warrior. These bears... they're not natural. They've been growing in number and boldness for months now.'\n\nHe places a weathered hand on your shoulder. 'If you truly seek to confront them, you must first understand what we're facing. There are three paths before you.'",
