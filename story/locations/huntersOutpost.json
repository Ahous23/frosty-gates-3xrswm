Must be something much larger than the shards we've found.\"\n\nShe pulls out Karina's journal, flipping to a page by the lantern's faint light. \"My sister wrote about this. The bears gather at sites where the crystals pulse. She thought they might be... communicating with something through them.\"\n\nLyra closes the journal, looking troubled. \"Whatever that light is, it's between us and Crystal Ridge. We'll need to be extremely careful.\"\n\nAnother flash illuminates the forest, closer this time, casting eerie blue shadows among the trees. In the momentary light, you catch glimpses of movement - large shapes moving through the forest in the distance.",

The terrain becomes challenging - fallen logs, tangled underbrush, and in places, marshy ground that threatens to swallow your boots. Despite the difficulties, you push on, always keeping the distant flashes of blue light to your right.\n\nAfter several exhausting hours, you reach the ravine Lyra mentioned. It cuts deeply into the landscape, with steep sides covered in loose rocks and stubborn vegetation. At the bottom, a small stream gurgles softly.\n\n\"We follow this downstream,\" Lyra explains, beginning her careful descent. \"It eventually curves back toward the ridge, but well away from whatever activity we saw.\"",

The ravine appears clear of large predators, but you spot what looks like animal tracks along the stream bank. They're not bear prints - they're too small, more like deer or wild goats.\n\nYou also note a small waterfall about a quarter-mile downstream, with what appears to be a cave opening behind it. Near the cave, something catches your eye - a faint, unnatural shape partially hidden by brush.\n\n\"Lyra,\" you whisper, pointing. \"By the waterfall. Is that...?\"\n\nShe squints, then her breath catches. \"A pack. That's a hunter's pack.\" Her voice becomes urgent. \"We need to check that out.\"",

The loose rocks and dirt make for treacherous going, but you manage to pick your way down without incident.\n\nAt the bottom, you follow the stream toward the waterfall. As you draw closer, the rush of falling water grows louder, creating a natural sound barrier that would mask any approaching danger. You remain vigilant, scanning your surroundings constantly.\n\nFinally, you reach the abandoned pack. It's weathered and partially covered by vegetation, suggesting it's been here for some time. Lyra kneels beside it, hands trembling slightly as she turns it over.\n\n\"It's Erikson's brother's pack,\" she says, voice tight with emotion. \"Not Karina's, but... one of the missing hunters.\" She carefully opens the main compartment, revealing sodden supplies, a broken compass, and a leather-bound journal protected in a waxed canvas wrapper.",

They're growing more common as we approach the ridge. Jens tried to break one off - said it might fetch good coin back at the settlement. Burned his hand something fierce. The crystals don't like being touched.\"\n\nFlipping forward several pages:\n\n\"Day 12: Bears everywhere. Not attacking, just... watching. Following. They don't move like normal bears. Torben says we should turn back. I agree, but Karina insists we continue. She's obsessed with finding the source of the crystals.\"\n\nThe final legible entry sends a chill down your spine:\n\n\"Day 15: Cave entrance located. Massive crystal formation inside, lighting everything blue. Bears are gathered around it, standing like men. There's something else in there, moving among them. Not a bear. Not human either. Karina went to get a closer look. It's been hours. I'm going to find her. If anyone reads this, tell Erikson his brother wasn't a coward.\"",

The main entrance is on the ridge, but this could be a back way in.\" Her voice drops to a near whisper. \"And Karina was alive at least until fifteen days ago.\"\n\nLyra stares at the waterfall, the cave entrance partially visible behind the curtain of water. \"My sister went in there looking for answers. So will I.\" She turns to you, her face set with determination. \"But I understand if you want to continue to the main entrance as planned. This could be dangerous.\"\n\nThe sky has lightened to a pre-dawn gray. Decision time.",

The cave entrance is partially obscured, but definitely large enough to enter without difficulty. The stone around the opening has an unusual quality - smooth striations that don't look naturally formed.\n\n\"Those look like claw marks,\" Lyra observes. \"But enormous, and methodical. Like the cave was... excavated.\"\n\nAs you step closer to the entrance, a faint blue glow becomes visible from deep within. It pulses slowly, like a heartbeat, illuminating the tunnel that leads downward into the earth. The air coming from the cave mouth is surprisingly warm and carries a strange metallic scent.\n\n\"Be ready for anything,\" you caution, checking your equipment one last time before proceeding.\n\nLyra nods, drawing her hunting knife. \"For Karina,\" she whispers, and steps into the cave.",
