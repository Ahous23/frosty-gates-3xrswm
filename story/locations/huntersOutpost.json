The hunters gather around as you share news of the attack.\n\n'Aye, we've seen them,' says Karina, the lead tracker. 'These ain't normal bears. Bigger, smarter. Some say they've seen them walking on two legs, carrying weapons.' She unfurls a crude map on the table. 'They've established a territory here, in the Crystal Caves. No hunter who's gone in has returned.'",

She stands and begins gathering her gear. 'I'll help you track them, Olaf, but I won't promise to follow you into their den. That kind of madness requires personal motivation.'\n\nWith Karina's expert tracking abilities at your side, your chances of finding the bears' lair have significantly improved.",

He presses the bow into your hands. 'It's a fine weapon. Silent. Better than charging in with an axe announcing your presence.'\n\nYou spend the night at the outpost, enjoying what might be your last comfortable sleep for some time. In the morning, you prepare to set out, now better equipped for the journey ahead.",
