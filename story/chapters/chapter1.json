Today, smoke rises from burned homes, and grief hangs heavy in the air.\n\nYou are Olaf, son of Bjorn the Mighty, the village's respected chieftain and most fearsome warrior. Or at least, he was until yesterday's dawn when the bears came.\n\nNot ordinary bears - these walked on two legs like men, wielded crude weapons, and worst of all, they seemed to communicate and coordinate their attack with terrifying intelligence.\n\nYou kneel beside your father's body as the village prepares for the funeral rites. His mighty axe 'Winterbite' lies broken beside him, having claimed several bear warriors before he fell.\n\n\"I will avenge you, father,\" you whisper, taking the leather necklace from his neck - a family heirloom carved with ancient runes.",

The mood is somber as Elder Hulda addresses everyone, her weathered face lined with worry.\n\n\"For generations, the bears of Wispwood Forest have been just beasts - dangerous, but predictable. But these... these are something else entirely. They moved with purpose, targeted our storehouses and warriors first. This was no random animal attack.\"\n\nMagnus, the village huntmaster, speaks up. \"I tracked similar bears last season. They had camps, Hulda. CAMPS. With tents and weapons. Something has changed them.\"\n\nMany voices rise in fear and confusion. Some speak of dark magic, others of a curse from the gods. Through it all, you remain silent, clutching your father's necklace.\n\nFinally, Elder Hulda raises her hands for silence. \"Olaf, son of Bjorn. Your father would have led our response to this threat. The village needs leadership now.\"\n\nAll eyes turn to you.",

With no obvious indication of which way to go, you're forced to guess.\n\n\"East seems to lead higher into the mountains,\" Karina observes.\n\nBefore you can decide, you hear a strange whistling sound from above. Looking up, you see a massive golden eagle diving toward you. Instinctively, you raise your weapon, but the bird pulls up short, hovering almost unnaturally before you.\n\nIt lets out a series of calls, then flies deliberately down the western path, circles back, and repeats the action.\n\n\"I think it's trying to guide us,\" Karina says with wonder in her voice.\n\nFollowing the eagle's guidance, you soon emerge into a hidden valley where a stone hut stands beside a small garden. An old man with a long white beard looks up from his work, nodding as if he's been expecting you.",

I've been watching the bears' transformation for months now.\"\n\nHe invites you into his simple home. Inside, the walls are covered with detailed sketches of bears in various poses - some on all fours as normal, others standing upright with increasing levels of what appears to be self-awareness in their eyes.\n\n\"It began in winter,\" Varric explains, pouring a bitter-smelling tea for each of you. \"A white bear came from the northern mountains, larger than any I'd seen. At first, I thought nothing of it - unusual coloring, but still just a bear. Then it began... changing. Growing more intelligent by the day. And those around it changed too, as if its transformation was contagious.\"\n\nKarina examines the sketches closely. \"How is this possible?\"\n\nVarric's expression darkens. \"The stone circle. Ancient magic sleeps there, from before our people came to these lands. Something has awakened it - or someone has.\"\n\nHe pulls out a worn leather journal. \"Three months ago, strangers came through the valley. Not locals - their clothes marked them as from far to the east. They performed some ritual at the stone circle under the light of the blood moon. After they left, the bears began to change.\"",

The transformation isn't just physical and mental - it's awakening primal rage within them. And if the white bear has claimed your father's medallion as a trophy...\"\n\n\"It's established itself as leader by killing the strongest human it could find,\" you finish grimly.\n\nVarric nods. \"The bears are taking prisoners to the stone circle for a purpose. According to these symbols, the transformation can be completed with a ritual sacrifice under the next blood moon - which is just three days from now.\"\n\nKarina gasps. \"All those people...\"\n\n\"If the ritual succeeds,\" Varric continues, \"the transformation becomes permanent and spreads to all bears in the region.

The sudden rattle sounds deafeningly loud in the quiet forest.\n\nThe bear in the watchtower jerks to attention, sniffing the air and letting out a deep, rumbling call that's clearly an alert.\n\n\"Run!\" you whisper urgently to Karina, but it's too late. The bear has spotted you and is climbing down from its perch with surprising agility. You hear answering calls from deeper in the forest. More are coming.",

At the far side, you spot the prisoner cage - a structure of lashed-together logs containing perhaps fifteen human captives.\n\nIn the center of the camp stands a large tent decorated with bones and strange symbols. As you watch, its flap opens and a massive white bear emerges. Even from this distance, you can see your father's medallion glinting around its neck in the firelight.\n\nYour hand tightens on your weapon as rage fills you, but you force yourself to remain still. The white bear confers with several other bears, pointing in various directions - clearly issuing orders. Its movements are unnervingly human, its bearing regal and commanding.",

Bears walking like men, they say. I'd have called it nonsense if three of my hunters hadn't gone missing last week.\"\n\nYou quickly explain the situation - the transformed bears, their leader, the planned ritual, and the attack your group intercepted. Gunnar's expression darkens with each detail.\n\n\"The blood moon is two days hence,\" he says gravely. \"Not much time to prepare.\"\n\n\"Will you help us?\" you ask directly.\n\nGunnar exchanges glances with his advisors. \"Twenty of my best warriors will ride with you at dawn.

Thrain arrives from Riverhaven with thirty warriors, bringing your forces to just over fifty. Not enough for a direct assault, but with a well-executed diversion...\n\nThat night, as you prepare your equipment for tomorrow's mission, Karina joins you by the fire.\n\n\"My brother told me the bears keep their food stores at the northwestern edge of their camp,\" she says. \"If a small team could slip in and set them ablaze, it might create enough chaos for the main force to approach from the south.\"\n\nYou nod, checking the edge on your axe. \"It's dangerous, but it could work.

Turning, you see Leif, bow in hand. \"I'm the fastest, and I know how to move silently.\"\n\n\"I'll go with him,\" Karina decides. \"He might need a healer.\"\n\nThe plan takes shape: Leif and Karina will lead a small team to create the diversion while you, Gunnar, Thrain, and Lyra lead the main force to the stone circle.
